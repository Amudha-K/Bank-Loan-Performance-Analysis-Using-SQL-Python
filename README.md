# Bank-Loan-Performance-Analysis-Using-SQL-Python 
## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a comprehensive Bank Loan Report designed to monitor and assess a bank's lending activities. By transforming raw data into actionable insights, this report helps stakeholders track loan portfolio health, identify seasonal trends, and evaluate borrower risk profiles.  

## Problem Statement
The bank required a data-driven solution to monitor lending performance. Key objectives included:  
Tracking MTD (Month-to-Date) and MoM (Month-over-Month) growth for applications and funding.  
Distinguishing between Good Loans (Fully Paid/Current) and Bad Loans (Charged Off) to assess portfolio risk.  
Analyzing borrower demographics (Employment, Home Ownership) and loan characteristics (DTI, Interest Rates).
